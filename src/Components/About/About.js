              <p>I've come from a very eclectic background, in which Iâ€™ve worked as a full-time DJ, waited tables while putting myself through college, and managed at Guitar Center. This experience has given me immense insight into how the world works and has lent me the opportunity to develop many useful life skills. I am hyper aware of detail and make sure to never cut corners. I am vigilant about deadlines and respect other people's time. I have always had a passion for computers and a mind for technology. Coding has come naturally to me, and I'm excited to be creating immersive virtual spaces that everyone can enjoy.<br /><br />I look forward to working with you!</p>
